 Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

- suitable for high-level abstraction of entities 
e.g. "student","tutor","course","box"....

-The basic element in OOP is a Class!!

-Classes are similar to data types(but much more advanced)

-Every instant of a class is an Object!!
e.g. 
	class Square(<-class) {...
	...}Square1(<-object)
	int x;

-Classes are very useful becouse they can be reused in many programs!!

-Classes constist of ->Data members
                     ->Function members

---> Classes are used BEFORE main().
